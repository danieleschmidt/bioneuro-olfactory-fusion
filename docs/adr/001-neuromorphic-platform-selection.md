# ADR-001: Neuromorphic Computing Platform Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion system requires efficient real-time processing of spiking neural networks for gas detection. Traditional computing platforms consume excessive power (100-250W) which is unsuitable for edge deployment and battery-powered operations. We need to select neuromorphic computing platforms that can deliver ultra-low power consumption (<10mW) while maintaining high accuracy and real-time response.

## Decision
We will support multiple neuromorphic hardware platforms with a unified abstraction layer:

### Primary Platforms
1. **Intel Loihi** - Primary target for production deployment
2. **SpiNNaker** - Secondary target for research and large-scale networks
3. **BrainScaleS** - Tertiary target for high-speed analog processing

### Fallback Platforms
1. **CPU/GPU** - Development, testing, and non-neuromorphic deployment
2. **FPGA** - Custom neuromorphic implementations (future)

## Rationale

### Intel Loihi Selection
- **Power Efficiency**: 30-100mW typical consumption vs 100-250W for GPU
- **Real-time Processing**: Hardware-accelerated spiking neural networks
- **Development Ecosystem**: Mature NXSDK with Python integration
- **Industry Support**: Intel's commitment to neuromorphic computing
- **Scalability**: Up to 131K neurons per chip, multi-chip scaling

### SpiNNaker Inclusion
- **Research Heritage**: University of Manchester's proven platform
- **Massive Parallelism**: 18 ARM cores per chip, 1M+ core systems
- **Real-time Guarantee**: 1ms biological time steps
- **Open Platform**: Academic accessibility and collaboration
- **Flexibility**: General-purpose neuromorphic computing

### BrainScaleS Consideration
- **Analog Speed**: 1000x faster than biological real-time
- **Low Latency**: Sub-microsecond processing capabilities
- **Plasticity**: On-chip learning and adaptation
- **Research Applications**: Cutting-edge neuromorphic algorithms

### CPU/GPU Fallback
- **Development Ease**: Standard Python/PyTorch workflow
- **Debugging**: Full visibility into network state and execution
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Standard cloud and edge infrastructure
- **Performance Baseline**: Comparison reference for neuromorphic gains

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Platform Independence**: Unified API across hardware backends
- **Power Efficiency**: 10-1000x reduction in power consumption
- **Real-time Capability**: Sub-100ms response times achievable
- **Research Collaboration**: Access to neuromorphic research community
- **Future-proofing**: Support for emerging neuromorphic platforms

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple backend implementations and testing
- **Hardware Dependency**: Limited availability of neuromorphic hardware
- **Development Overhead**: Platform-specific optimization requirements
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Limited visibility in neuromorphic hardware
- **Performance Variation**: Different platforms have different capabilities

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Hardware Availability**: Maintain CPU/GPU fallback for all deployments
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Abstraction layer prevents platform dependency
- **Performance Issues**: Benchmark and optimize for each platform
- **Support Gaps**: Strong community engagement and documentation

## Implementation

### Abstraction Layer Design
```python
class NeuromorphicBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compile_network(self, network: SNNModel) -> CompiledNetwork
    
    @abstractmethod
    def run_inference(self, inputs: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_energy_metrics(self) -> EnergyMetrics
```

### Platform-Specific Features
- **Loihi**: NXSDK integration, power optimization
- **SpiNNaker**: PyNN compatibility, real-time guarantees
- **BrainScaleS**: Analog parameter optimization, high-speed processing
- **CPU/GPU**: Full debugging, rapid prototyping

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: CPU/GPU for algorithm development
2. **Testing**: Neuromorphic simulators for validation
3. **Production**: Loihi for edge deployment
4. **Research**: SpiNNaker/BrainScaleS for advanced algorithms
