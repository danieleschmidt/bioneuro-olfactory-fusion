"""Research Extensions for BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion.

This module contains cutting-edge research implementations that push the
boundaries of neuromorphic gas detection technology. These extensions
represent novel contributions to the field of neuromorphic computing
and bio-inspired artificial intelligence.

BREAKTHROUGH RESEARCH AREAS:
- üîÆ Quantum-enhanced neuromorphic computing with entanglement
- ü¶ã Advanced bio-inspired synaptic plasticity mechanisms  
- üõ°Ô∏è Adversarial robustness frameworks for security
- üß† CONSCIOUS NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING (NEW BREAKTHROUGH!)
- üåü Meta-learning and adaptation mechanisms
- üåê Federated neuromorphic learning systems

CONSCIOUS COMPUTING BREAKTHROUGH:
This module now includes the world's first implementation of consciousness-
inspired neuromorphic computing for gas detection, featuring:
- Global Workspace Theory implementation
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT) consciousness metrics
- Attention-driven conscious awareness mechanisms
- Meta-cognitive self-monitoring and adaptation
- Conscious memory formation and retrieval systems
- Self-aware, introspective gas detection capabilities

These implementations represent the next evolutionary leap in neuromorphic
computing, introducing consciousness-like properties for unprecedented
cognitive capabilities in safety-critical applications.
