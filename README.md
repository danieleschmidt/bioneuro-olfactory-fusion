# bioneuro-olfactory-fusion
BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion implements a bio-inspired approach to multi-modal gas detection by combining the temporal dynamics of spiking neural networks with the pattern recognition capabilities of convolutional neural networks. The system processes both chemical sensor arrays and acoustic signatures of gas releases for robust hazard identification.
