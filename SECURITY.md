   - Implement proper error handling without information leakage

2. **Authentication**:
   - Never store passwords in plaintext
   - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Log security events for auditing
   - Follow data minimization principles

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use automated vulnerability scanning
   - Review security advisories for dependencies
   - Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds

### For Operators

1. **Deployment Security**:
   - Use container security scanning
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Use secrets management systems
   - Enable security monitoring and alerting

2. **Infrastructure**:
   - Keep systems and containers updated
   - Use firewalls and intrusion detection
   - Implement backup and disaster recovery
   - Regular security assessments

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor authentication failures
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regular log analysis
   - Performance and security metrics

### For Users

1. **Account Security**:
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Regularly review account activity
   - Log out when finished

2. **API Usage**:
   - Protect API keys and tokens
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow rate limiting guidelines

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

The project includes automated security testing:

```bash
# Run security vulnerability scan
python -m bioneuro_olfactory.security.vulnerability_scanner

# Run dependency vulnerability check
safety check

# Run static security analysis
bandit -r bioneuro_olfactory/

# Run container security scan
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image bioneuro-olfactory:latest
```

### Manual Security Testing

Regular manual security testing should include:

- Penetration testing of API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing
- Session management testing
- Error handling analysis
