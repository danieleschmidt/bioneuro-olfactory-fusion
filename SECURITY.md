## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

- **Email**: security@terragonlabs.com
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: [Create Advisory](https://github.com/terragonlabs/bioneuro-olfactory-fusion/security/advisories/new)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will:

1. Acknowledge the vulnerability within 48 hours
2. Provide an estimated timeline for a fix within 5 business days
3. Release a security patch as soon as possible
4. Credit the reporter in our security acknowledgments (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Considerations

### Sensor Data Privacy
- All sensor data should be treated as potentially sensitive
- Implement data anonymization for training datasets
- Use encryption for data transmission in production environments

### Neuromorphic Hardware Security
- Validate all hardware interfaces before deployment
- Monitor for anomalous power consumption patterns
- Implement secure boot procedures for embedded systems

### Chemical Detection Integrity
- Validate sensor calibration regularly
- Implement tamper detection for physical sensors
- Use cryptographic signatures for critical alert messages

### Dependency Security
- All dependencies are scanned using `safety` and `bandit`
- Regular updates are applied via Dependabot
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated for releases

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Run pre-commit hooks (includes `bandit` security linting)
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices for sensor interfaces

### For Deployment
- Use TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Implement proper authentication for monitoring endpoints
- Regular security audits of deployed systems
- Monitor for unusual network activity or sensor readings

## Compliance

This project follows:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** for industrial safety systems
- **IEC 61508** functional safety standards for hazardous gas detection
- **GDPR** requirements for any personal data collection
- **OSHA** guidelines for workplace safety monitoring systems

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Within 1 hour**: Notify security team
3. **Within 24 hours**: Assess impact and begin containment
4. **Within 72 hours**: Report to relevant authorities if required
5. **Post-incident**: Conduct review and update procedures
