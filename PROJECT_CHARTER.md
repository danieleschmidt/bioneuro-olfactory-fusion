# BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion  
**Project Code**: BNOF-2025  
**Charter Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  

## Executive Summary

BioNeuro-Olfactory-Fusion is an open-source neuromorphic computing framework that revolutionizes hazardous gas detection through bio-inspired spiking neural networks. By combining electronic nose sensors with acoustic feature analysis, the system delivers ultra-efficient, real-time chemical hazard identification for critical safety applications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Energy Inefficiency**: Traditional AI-based gas detection systems consume excessive power (100-250W), limiting deployment in remote or battery-powered environments
2. **Single-Modal Limitations**: Existing systems rely primarily on chemical sensors, missing acoustic signatures that provide early warning indicators
3. **Latency Issues**: Current solutions require 500ms-5s for detection, too slow for emergency response scenarios
4. **False Positive Rates**: High false alarm rates (5-15%) reduce system effectiveness and user trust
5. **Hardware Dependencies**: Limited scalability due to reliance on expensive, specialized detection equipment

### Market Need
- Industrial facilities lose $50B annually due to gas-related incidents
